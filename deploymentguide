### **Deploying a Java Full-Stack Application (React + Spring Boot + MySQL)**

#### **Step 1: Ensure the Application is Working Locally**
Before deploying, make sure that:
- Your **React frontend** is working properly by running it locally (`npm start`).
- Your **Spring Boot backend** is running correctly 
- The **MySQL database** is connected and running.

#### **Step 2: Push Code to GitHub**
1. **Initialize Git** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. **Add all your files to Git**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
3. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit of full-stack app"
   ```
4. **Create a GitHub repository** (if not already created).
5. **Add the remote repository URL**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   ```
6. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

#### **Step 3: Deploy the Frontend (React) to Netlify**
1. **Sign up on Netlify**:
   - Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and sign up using your **GitHub** account.
   
2. **Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub**:
   - After signing up, Netlify will ask you to authorize GitHub. You can either authorize **all repositories** or select specific ones for deployment.

3. **Add a New Site**:
   - Once logged in, click on **"Add new site"**.
   - Choose **GitHub** as the source of your project.

4. **Select Your React Repository**:
   - Find your **React repository** in the list of GitHub repositories.
   - Click on your React repo to deploy.

5. **Configure Deployment**:
   - Choose the **branch** to deploy (usually `main`).
   - Set the **build command** as `npm run build`.
   - Set the **publish directory** as `build`.

6. **Deploy the Site**:
   - Click **Deploy site** to start the deployment process.
   - Wait for the build to complete.

7. **Get the Deployment Link**:
   - After the deployment is complete, youâ€™ll receive a link to your live React app hosted on Netlify.
   - You can customize the site name by clicking on **Site settings** and changing the name as you like.
